Just another GTK Tetris

INTRODUCTION
------------
This is a simple Tetris clone for the GTK library, it was mainly written
for fun and to learn how to use GTK. If you have any questions, suggestions
or you want to tell me your highscore, feel free to contact me. It's
always nice to know that someone is useing the software :)

INSTALLATION
------------
Edit the Makefile and make sure everything is set right. If you run X at a
high resolution you may want to try to uncomment -DBIGBLOCKS in the
Makefile and then recompile.

If you need to recompile for your system type:
make clean
make

To install binary:
make install

The default install path is /usr/local/bin

Have fun.
